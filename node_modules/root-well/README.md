## /Root 

The Function design language system, or /root, will provide staff, clients, and customers a shared understanding of our visual style, provide better access to analogue and digital resources, and streamline all contributions into a single, coherent system. This system will enable all users to prototype and experiment with ideas in high fidelity faster, at a lower cost, and in a more consistent voice.

Our goal is to drive greater efficiency through well-defined, reusable components. Each component has a function and personality, will be defined by a set of properties, can co-exists with others and can evolve independently. This is a design language that won’t just be a set of static rules and one-off assets, but an evolving ecosystem populated and maintained by team members. 

The Scope: 
For each component, we’ll determine how to deploy, where to use, articulate the purpose for creation. Component types to be analyzed: 
+ Colors
+ Logos
+ Typography, including rules around weighting, sizing, vertical alignment
+ Iconography
+ Templates
+ Grid/Layouts
+ Interactions
+ Animations
+ Accessibility
+ Social
+ Email
+ Forms
+ Illustrations
+ Patterns
